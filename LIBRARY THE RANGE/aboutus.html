            <pre>

Library: The Range was founded by a college IT student named Sagun Singh as a part of a hackathon project.

The aim was to create an e-repository providing the links to downloadable PDFs or eBooks to the most loved books all over the world. The 
books are divided into 18 different genres (that you can find in the genres section in the navigation bar above) to make it easier for people to 
look for their favourite kind of books. 

Overtime, more updates will be introduced that would make your reading experience more easy and fun.
